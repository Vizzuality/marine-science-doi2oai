    "description": [
        "Humans are regularly cited as the main driver of current biodiversity extinction, but the impact of historic volcanic activity is often overlooked. Pre-human evidence of wildlife abundance and diversity are essential for disentangling anthropogenic impacts from natural events. R\u00e9union Island, with its intense and well-documented volcanic activity, endemic biodiversity, long history of isolation and recent human colonization, provides an opportunity to disentangle these processes. We track past demographic changes of a critically endangered seabird, the Mascarene petrel Pseudobulweria aterrima, using genome-wide SNPs. Coalescent modeling suggested that a large ancestral population underwent a substantial population decline in two distinct phases, ca. 125,000 and 37,000 years ago, coinciding with periods of major eruptions of Piton des Neiges. Subsequently, the ancestral population was fragmented into the two known colonies, ca. 1,500 years ago, following eruptions of Piton de la Fournais...",
        "Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) genotyping was carried out by Diversity Arrays Technology (DarT Pty Ltd, Canberra) using the DArTseq protocol. DArT library was prepared using DNA from 93 birds and the restriction enzymes PstI and SphI.\u00a0 Loci were aligned to the genome assembly of Calonectris borealis (family Procellariidae; GCA_013401115.1).\nThe raw DArTseq data (67,095 SNPs) was filtered by the authors using the dartR v 2.1.4 R package (see manuscript for details). Four genomic datasets (dataset 1 \u2013 dataset 4) were generated and used for the downstream analyses (See Text S1 and Fig. S8 for details).\nSpecimen metadata was collated during fieldwork.",
